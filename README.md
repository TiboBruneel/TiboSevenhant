## Hi there, I am Tibo 👋

### I am a student, frontend developer and designer!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on some voluntary rebrandings and helping with startups, as an extra during my free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frameworks better and more getting into native app development.
- 📚 I'm currently pursuing a bachelor in Multimedia and Communication Technology at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Belgium.
- 💻 I work as a software engineer at Storebugs as a student job.
- 🌍 My dream is to travel the world and become a great software engineer.
- 🙌 My goal for this year is to learn as much as possible and to gain a lot of experience with different technologies, backend and frontend development.
